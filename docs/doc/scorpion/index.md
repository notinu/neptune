# Scorpion <Badge type="warning" text="requires 180"/>

Scorpion is a reliable _TSS &rarr; TSS/TSM &rarr; 2xTST Tower_ opener. It was discovered May 2023. 

## 1<sup>st</sup> Bag

![First bag](./2.gif){width=150px}

This shape can be stacked with $24.29 \%$ of bags. With the mirrored setup, the probability rises to $32.70 \%$. Generally, it can be built when $O$ comes early and $S$ comes late.

## 2<sup>nd</sup> Bag

This shape can be stacked with $100 \%$ of bags while keeping B2B. *With hold*, the following setup works for all permutations of $S, J, T$:

*180 rotations* are also necessary to guarantee stacking this shape, as $L$ cannot otherwise be placed after $Z$ and $O$.

## 3<sup>rd</sup> Bag

With the third bag the user can stack a full *2xTST Tower* with $95.91 \%$ of bags.

#### Early S solution

This solution leads to clean stacking, so it should be checked for first.

#### L, S, Z solutions

These solutions are easy to identify due to the $L, Z$ shape along with $S$ being fixed. The remaining pieces can be freestyled fairly easily, but fail when $I > J > O$ and $T > J$.

#### I, J solutions

The remaining solutions are slightly harder to spot since only $I, J$ placements are fixed.

::: warning
3rd bag solutions are not so straightforward and should be practiced, especially if you are using Scorpion in VS.
